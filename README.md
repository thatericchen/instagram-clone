## Introduction
Fully-functioning clone of Instagram's feed page. Implements Tailwind CSS for responsive user interface design, Firebase V.9 for storage API and image uploading, NextAuth.js for custom user Google authentication screen, and Recoil for state management. Main functionalities include uploading images with captions, liking posts, commenting on posts, and signing in to personal Google accounts. This program was an introductory project to web development.

## Updates
* Fixed internal server error when user tries to sign into their Google account.
* Changed modal component design.
* Adjusted responsive UI design by collapsing suggestions component and resizing posts component to medium-sized screens.

## Next Steps
These are the current problems being considered for improvement or addition to the program. The following issues/solutions are in no particular order.
* Improve feed UI on different size screens.
* Improve signin page UI on smaller screens.
* Implement video uploading.
* Implement @ and # functionalities.
* Implement bookmark animation.
* Allow click on comment button to prompt user to comment.
